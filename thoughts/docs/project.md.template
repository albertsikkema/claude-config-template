## Technical Architecture

### Backend (This Repository)
**Technology Stack**:
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: FastAPI Users
- **AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI
- **Search**: Azure AI Search
- **Testing**: pytest with two-tier strategy (unit + integration)
- **Deployment**: Azure Container Instances
- **Package Management**: uv (modern Python dependency management)

**Key Patterns**:
- Service layer architecture (separation of API and business logic)
- Two-tier testing: Fast unit tests (mocked DB) + comprehensive integration tests (real DB)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Structured logging with error context (never expose raw exceptions)
- Environment-based configuration

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Azure Cloud
- **Container Registry**: Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- **Compute**: Azure Container Instances
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (managed)

### Development Workflow
- **Dependency Management**: uv for fast, deterministic builds
- **Code Quality**: Ruff linting and formatting, pre-commit hooks
- **Testing**: Unit tests (<2s), integration tests (Docker-based)
- **Local Development**: Docker Compose for full stack
- **Version Control**: Git with protected main branch
