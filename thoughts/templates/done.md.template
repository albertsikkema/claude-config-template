## Notes

**When to Add**:
- When item is **fully complete** (tested, reviewed, merged, deployed)
- Immediately after checking off in todo.md
- Include current month/year section if it doesn't exist

**What to Include**:
- Completion date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Link to implementation plan (if one existed)
- Link to research document (if research was done)
- Link to ADR (if architectural decision was made)
- Link to PR/commit

**Archival** (Optional):
- After 6-12 months, consider moving older sections to archive file
- Git history preserves everything, so safe to remove old items
