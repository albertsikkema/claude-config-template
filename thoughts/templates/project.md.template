> [One-line description of the project]

## What We're Building

[2-3 paragraphs describing:
- What the product/system does
- Who it's for (target users)
- Core value proposition
- Key differentiators (optional)]

## Why

[1-2 paragraphs covering:
- Problem being solved
- Why existing solutions aren't adequate
- Business case or motivation]

## Success Metrics

**MVP Success Criteria**:
- [Quantifiable metric 1]
- [Quantifiable metric 2]
- [Quantifiable metric 3]

**Long-term Goals** (optional):
- [Future metric or goal]

## Technical Stack

**Backend**:
- Framework: [e.g., FastAPI, Django, Express]
- Language: [e.g., Python 3.11, TypeScript]
- Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- Authentication: [e.g., JWT, OAuth2]

**Frontend** (if applicable):
- Framework: [e.g., React, Vue, Svelte]
- State Management: [e.g., Redux, Zustand]
- UI Library: [e.g., Tailwind, MUI]

**Infrastructure**:
- Hosting: [e.g., AWS, Vercel, Railway]
- CI/CD: [e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI]
- Monitoring: [e.g., Sentry, DataDog]

**Development**:
- Version Control: Git + [GitHub/GitLab]
- Package Manager: [npm, pip, cargo]
- Code Quality: [linters, formatters, pre-commit hooks]

## Key Constraints

**Technical**:
- [Constraint, e.g., "Must support offline mode"]
- [Constraint, e.g., "Must work on mobile devices"]

**Business**:
- [Constraint, e.g., "GDPR compliance required"]
- [Constraint, e.g., "Must integrate with existing CRM"]

**Resource**:
- [Constraint, e.g., "Solo developer, 3-month timeline"]
- [Constraint, e.g., "Limited budget for third-party services"]

## Architecture Overview

[2-3 paragraphs or simple ASCII diagram describing:
- System architecture (monolith vs microservices)
- Key components and their relationships
- Data flow
- Integration points]

**Example**:
```
┌─────────────┐
│   React     │  Frontend (SPA)
│   Client    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ HTTPS/REST
┌──────▼──────┐
│   FastAPI   │  Backend API
│   Server    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
┌──────▼──────┐
│ PostgreSQL  │  Database
└─────────────┘
```

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT Doing** (at least for MVP):
- [Feature/capability, e.g., "Mobile native apps"]
- [Technology, e.g., "GraphQL API"]
- [Problem, e.g., "Multi-currency support"]
- [Integration, e.g., "Social media login"]
